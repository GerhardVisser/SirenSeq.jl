# SirenSeq

A tool for composing and sequencing music using Julia.  The gaol is to remove the need for GUI tools when composing, recording and sequencing music by doing it all using Julia scripts and the SirenSeq module.  At this time only MIDI file composition is implemented.  Later versions will work by using csound for audio recording, playing and manipulation.

Tutorials and examples not yet implemented.
