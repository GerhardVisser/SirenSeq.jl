# SirenSeq

A tool for composing and sequencing music using Julia.  The goal is to remove the need for GUI tools when composing, recording and sequencing music by doing it all using Julia scripts and the SirenSeq module.  At this time only MIDI file composition is implemented.  Later versions will work by using csound for audio recording, playing and manipulation.

Compatable only with linux.  The submodule SirenSeq.Render requires that musescore is installed.  The submodule SirenSeq.Play requires that pmidi is installed.

Tutorials and examples not yet implemented.
